### Approach and Assumptions
## Approach
The project was built using React.js to create a dynamic and responsive web application. The VisionClarification component fetches data from an API and displays it in a grid of cards. Each card can be clicked to select it, applying a gradient border to the selected card. A sidebar with SVG icons and a navigation button were also included to enhance the user interface.

## Assumptions
- The API endpoint used (https://entities-alpha.vercel.app/entity_details) is always available and returns the expected data format.
- The project is primarily viewed on a desktop screen, so responsiveness for smaller screens may need additional adjustments.
- All necessary SVG icons are provided and correctly placed within the sidebar.
